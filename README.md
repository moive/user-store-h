# REST USER STORE Project + TypeScript

This pre-initialized project includes everything needed to work with TypeScript, Express, and REST APIs.

All configuration steps have already been completed in the course, so you only need to clone the project and start working.

## Installation

1. Clone `.env.template` to `.env` and configure your environment variables
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. If a database is required, configure `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` to start the desired services
4. Load data with `npm run seed`, only in development
5. Run `npm run dev` to launch the project in development mode
